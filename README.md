# Ansible Role: Apache Jena/Fuseki SPARQL Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paginagmbh/ansible-role-fuseki.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paginagmbh/ansible-role-fuseki)

An Ansible Role that installs [Apache Jena/Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) on Linux.

## Requirements

A Java runtime has to be installed on the target host.
When used from Enterprise Linux, remember to add selinux boolean for `httpd_can_network_connect` if fuseki is behind an Apache webserver.

## Example Playbook

``` yaml
- role: geerlingguy.java
- role: fuseki
  fuseki_configurations:
    - name: "test-db"
      read_write: True
      union_default_graph: False
      service_enhancer: true
      shacl: true # creates dataset/shacl service
```

## Tests

To run the test playbook(s):

  1. Install and start Docker.
  1. Download the test shim (see .travis.yml file for the URL) into `tests/test.sh`:
  1. Make the test shim executable: `chmod +x tests/test.sh`.
  1. Run (from the role root directory) `distro=[distro] playbook=[playbook] ./tests/test.sh`

If you don't want the container to be automatically deleted after the test playbook is run, add the following environment variables:

    cleanup=false container_id=$(date +%s)
